1) Food & Nutrition
With food and agriculture engineering sciences, we can achieve the proper intake of carbohydrates, proteins, and vitamins. Here’s where to find them:

● Carbohydrates – find them in vegetables and rice.

● Proteins – look for them in white meat such as fish and chicken, and red meat like lamb and beef.

● Vitamins – you can get vitamins from fruits such as oranges, mangoes, and many others.


2) Sleep Is Important
A minimum of 8 hours of good sleep is recommended for best productivity. However, going up
to 10 hours on weekends and free days is not a bad idea as well.


3) Holy Religious Sciences
Following Muslim principles from the Quran: namaz-salah, fast-roza, Makkah hajj pilgrimage
Holy Kaaba, and zakat-donation.


4) Stay In Shape
Gym workout exercises are also important – doing pushups and yoga after waking up is a great
way to stay in shape.


5) Business Engineering Finance
Another important matter for manufacturing, production of a product, brand and logo for
services, consultancies, and counseling.


6) Internet Marketing Engineering
You should be using SEO as an organic advertisement strategy. While this is a great way to get
leads, you should also focus on SEM for paid marketing. Both can be applied for all of your
services, products, brand and logo.


7) Online Sales Engineering
Cash, cheque payment or online payment transactions also ensure ease-of-use experience.
Everything mentioned above is for a better Future – Mustakbil.
